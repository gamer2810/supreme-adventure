Landing the job was not that straightforward. I had to go through a resume screening, a face-to-face interview with my school's director and a faculty recommendation round. My 4.0 GPA definitely paid off in the process, and now I’m learning what it really means to work in the U.S., both inside the classroom and beyond it.

Afterwards came a bunch of firsts - applying for an SSN, filling out the W-4, and sitting through the I-9 process. All part of the deal.

What really stands out to me is the work culture. People are always on time, and everything runs on procedures. It’s different from what I was used to, but I’m getting the hang of it.

I feel like school nowadays is getting more and more individualized. Students would just go to class and then back home. Afterall, you just need to pass tests and grab those credits. Interactions with faculty and peers do not seem as important anymore. But getting this job made me realize that I was wrong. Going the extra mile by going to office hours, getting to know your professors and classmates will definitely pay off in the long run. It will increase your visibility to potential employers and therefore your chance of being offered a position.

So my advice? Don’t just go through the motions. Get involved, make connections, and take advantage of every chance to learn. You never know which steps will make a difference down the road.

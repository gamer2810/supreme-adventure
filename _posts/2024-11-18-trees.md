## Binary Tree

## Tree Traversal

## Binary Search Tree

## AVL Tree

## B-Tree
Balanced Search Tree

### Simulator

### Idea
A searching data structure like Binary Search Tree (BST) but can hold more data inside each node

=> Reduce searching time 

**Core Mechanism: Maximum degree**
A positive integer **M** that indicates:
1. Minimum number of children (except root): M/2
2. Maximum number of children (including root): M
3. Minimum number of elements inside one node: (M/2) - 1
4. Maximum number of elements inside one node: M - 1

The minimum number will cause merging\
The maximum number will cause splitting
{: .prompt-tip }

### Operations

Revolves around merging splitting nodes.

Insertion:
Insert new node at the right leaf, splits current nodes into siblings if there are more elements
bounded by the maximum degree.

Recursively check parent nodes if splitting causes them to have more children than the maximum, splitting if necessary.

## B+ Tree
### Simulator

[B+ Tree Simulator](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/BPlusTree.html)

### Idea
B+ Tree is a B-Tree with some extra features
1. All data are stored on the leaf level
2. Leaf nodes are connected to each other like a linked list

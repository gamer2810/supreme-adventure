## **Pre-Trip Planning**

Getting the essentials sorted before you go can make your trip much smoother. Here’s what I focused on.

### **Mobile Network & Connectivity**

I bought an **SKT E-Sim** and verified my passport at their airport kiosk to enable calls and texts. This was incredibly helpful, especially for booking restaurant tables, as many places require a local phone number for reservations or waitlists. When you pick up the sim at the airport kiosk, you can get a free T-money card. The card does *not* come with any fund so you will need to recharge it using the CUs (there are some inside the Incheon Airport Terminal 1).

If you only want internet connection, SKT also offers a 5G only E-Sim for a cheaper price.

### **Where to Stay: Hongdae vs. Myeongdong**

Two of the most popular neighborhoods for tourists are Hongdae and Myeongdong. Hongdae is known for its youthful energy, arts scene, and nightlife, while Myeongdong is a bustling hub for shopping and street food. 

Be aware that Hongdae is **very** crowded on weekends. Every cafes and restaurants will be filled. If you are not fond of waiting then I do not recommend staying there.

For my trip, I stayed at the **Travelodge Myeongdong Namsan** and found it to be a fantastic central base for exploring. It is 2 blocks away from Myeongdong so you can walk over easily while is not as crowded. There are many foreigner-friendly restaurants nearby if you do not feel comfortable communicating with local people who do not know English. As a bonus, the hotel is located near the airport limousine bus stops so getting to it from the Incheon Airport is very easy.

### **A Note on Luggage: To Laptop or Not?**

I considered leaving my laptop behind to travel lighter, but decided not to. This turned out to be a bad idea. As I discovered later (see my observations below), most local cafes in Seoul aren't set up for long work sessions. If you don't absolutely need it, consider leaving the laptop at home. Personally, I felt exhausted from all the walking and exploration that I barely got on my laptop throughout the trip.

### **From the Airport (Incheon Terminal 1):**

You can use either the *AREX* (airport train) or the airport limousine. 

* **AREX (Subway):** ~5000 KRW.
  You will need a T-money card to use the subway station.

Takes around 1 hours and 30 mins. Be aware that you will need to transfer to another line to get to your hotel so I do not recommend it if you have a lot of luggage.

* **Airport limousine (RECOMMENDED):** 17000 KRW.

You can buy ticket from the **bus ticket kiosks** at the airport exits. You can also check for departure times / destinations there.

Alternatively, you can pay with cash/ tmoney card when you get on the bus.

The bus is very comfortable with dedicated luggage storage below the bus and stowage for your carry-on on the bus. The bus is not crowded and the seat is very comfortable with recliner chair and lots of leg space.

### **Getting Around the City**

Seoul’s public transport is world-class.

* **Subway:** The subway system is extensive, efficient, and easy to navigate with apps like Naver Map or Kakao Map. It connects to virtually every corner of the city. I recommend using Naver Map as it shows the station names in English.
* **Buses:** For routes not covered by the subway, the bus system is a great alternative.

## **Trip Experiences & Highlights**

Here are some of the standout moments and must-do activities from my time in Seoul.

### **Visiting the Royal Palaces**

To make the most of your visit to Seoul's historic palaces (like Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung), I highly recommend two things:

* **Buy the Combination Ticket:** It grants you access to multiple palaces for a discounted price.
* **Book the Secret Garden Tour:** The tour for Changdeokgung Palace's "Secret Garden" (Huwon) must be booked in advance online. It's absolutely worth it!

### **Hiking in Bukhansan National Park**

A nature escape right on the edge of the city! Here are my tips for tackling the trails.

**General Advice:**

* Be prepared for bugs, sudden rain, and strong sunlight. Long sleeves are a good idea.
* Use **Naver Map** and switch to the "Hiking Trail" layer. Search for your specific trail to ensure you don't get lost.

**For Beginners or a Casual Stroll:**
Check out the **Bukhansan Dulle-gil**. This is a well-maintained trail that circles the base of the national park. The path consists mostly of stairs and paved roads, offering beautiful scenery without a strenuous climb.

### **The Unforgettable NANTA Show**

I'm not usually a fan of performance art, but this show completely blew my mind. It’s a high-energy, non-verbal performance combining comedy, acrobatics, and percussive music using kitchen utensils.

* **No Korean needed:** You do not need to understand a word of Korean to enjoy it.
* **Perfect for an evening in Myeongdong:** If you have two hours to spare, I can't recommend it enough.
* **Book ahead!** Make reservations at least a week in advance to secure the best seats.

## **Dining Diary: My Favorite Eats**

The food in Seoul was a huge highlight. Here are the places that I'm still dreaming about.

### **Kimchi Jjigae at `삼청동김치찌개` (Samcheongdong Kimchi Jjigae)**

* **Kakao Map:** <https://kko.kakao.com/0aSf6tO9O6>
* **My Experience:** This felt like a true local gem. We were the only foreigners there! The host didn't speak English, but we easily ordered by pointing at the menu and using a translator app. She was incredibly warm and even showed us the proper way to enjoy the meal. It’s a cozy spot, and a bowl of their hot soup on a rainy day was heavenly.
* **What I Tried:**

  * **BBQ Pork:** Impressively tender and flavorful. It comes with a side of leafy greens for wrapping the meat—definitely recommended!
  * **Kimchi Jjigae (Soup):** A serving is required per person (~15,000 KRW each) and comes with rice. It's best enjoyed with the delicious side dishes (banchan) they provide.

### **Herbal Chicken Porridge at `이화 누룽지 삼계탕` (Yiwa Nurungji Samgyetang)**

* **Kakao Map:** <https://kko.kakao.com/vHVxQgGYKo>
* **My Experience:** This place is *very* popular with locals, and for good reason. Be prepared for a wait—we waited for about three hours! **Pro Tip:** Go to the restaurant, leave your phone number with the staff, and they will call you when your table is ready. The wait was extremely worth it.
* **What I Tried:**

  * **Samgyetang (Ginseng Chicken Soup):** For 17,000 KRW, you get a whole (though small) chicken simmered with rice, green mung beans, and traditional herbs until it’s incredibly tender. It comes with unlimited self-serve banchan and, after 2 PM, unlimited *makgeolli* (rice wine)!

### **Casual Wine & Dine at Nue Haus**

* **My Experience:** A nice, casual dining spot with a good wine selection, making it perfect for a small celebration. The food was decent but didn't stand out as much as other meals. The tiramisu, however, is definitely worth a try.
* **Note on Pricing:** The menu lists prices in units of 10,000 KRW (e.g., a price of "0.8" means 8,000 KRW).

### **Tip: Use Kakao Map's "Trending Places"**

For more food inspiration, explore the "Trending Places" or popular search features on Kakao Map. It's a great way to see what's currently popular with locals.

## **Final Thoughts & Cultural Observations**

A few final tips and observations to help you on your way.

* **Cafe Etiquette:** Unlike Western chains like Starbucks, most local cafes do not encourage laptop usage for work. If you need to work for more than a couple of hours, look for cafes that have designated "work seats" or cubicles with power outlets.
* **Punctuality is Key:** Everything in Seoul runs on time. If you've booked a guided tour, a show, or a performance, plan ahead and account for your transportation time.
* **Communicating with Locals:** In my experience, Korean people will try their best to communicate with you, even with a language barrier. Please be patient, respectful, and have a translator app ready. A little effort goes a long way!
* **The Hidden Cutlery Drawer:** If you sit down at a local restaurant and don't see forks or spoons, check for a small drawer built into the side of your table. This is where the tableware is often stored!
* **Clean up before you leave:** Some cafes and restaurants expect you to clean up after yourself. If you see a *Return* sign, please place your empty glasses / tray there after you have finished.
